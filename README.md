# mirpkgs - Nix packages for reproducible MIR research

This repository contains a set of [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) packages for music information retrieval (MIR) research. It's currently mostly Python packages re-packaged from PyPI or GitHub. Long term these packages would preferably be included in [nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs) in order to be community maintained, and built and cached by [their system](https://hydra.nixos.org/project/nixpkgs), but for now this repository is a convenient way for me to share current progress and collaborate on development with friends and peers.
